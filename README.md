# Misestat
Misestat - is statistic of your mouse activity.

This app is only for fun to see some statistics when you are working on computer.

The application shows such data:
- how far do you travel with the mouse while moving it across the monitors
- how many meters or kilometers scrolled with the mouse wheel
- how many times you pressed the mouse buttons, both separately on the left and right, and on all at once
- also if you do not operate the mouse, your idle time is counted and the longest period is recorded

Have some fun!
